LMAO IM SO DUMB... my .git folder isn't in this repo so that sucks... will fix with directions but it works for me right now !! 

read me description to be improved :

DIRECTIONS: 

rename the .env-copy file to .env
then fill in with your specific values and you'll also probably need to change the path directions in prepare-commit-message in the git/hooks/prepare-commit-message

pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 scripts/setup_git_hook.py
