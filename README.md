LMAO IM SO DUMB... my .git folder isn't in this repo so that sucks... will fix with directions but it works for me right now !!

read me description to be improved :

description: whenever you commit, it shows you what you were listening to at the time of the commit !! which is actually so cutesie and so slay ?! hello ?!

uh: code is in my .git folder and i'm kind of procrastinating with putting code because one time i screwed up and pushed a file and revealed my api key which was the dumbest mistake and i'm never doing that again i swear i learned my lesson...

[need to be fixed]:

DIRECTIONS:

rename the .env-copy file to .env
then fill in with your specific values and you'll also probably need to change the path directions in prepare-commit-message in the git/hooks/prepare-commit-message
then debug because i probably forgot something

pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 scripts/setup_git_hook.py
